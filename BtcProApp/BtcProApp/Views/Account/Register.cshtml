14. Disclaimer:

   Risk Factors Btcpro is not responsible for any loss or
   damage incurred by you as a result of your use of our
   Services or for your failure to understand the nature
   of virtual currencies or the market for such 
   currencies. All we are providing you is a method by 
   which you can exchange, trade, and store certain
   virtual currencies, and we make no representations
   or warranties concerning the value, stability, or
   legality of any such virtual currencies.

   You acknowledge the following risks related to your use
   of the Site and the Services:

   1. The risk of loss in trading virtual currencies such
      as Bitcoin (collectively, “Digital Assets”) may be
      substantial and losses may occur over a short period
      of time.
   2. The price and liquidity of Digital Assets has been
      subject to large fluctuations in the past and may be
      subject to large fluctuations in the future.
   3. Digital Assets are not legal tender, not backed
      by any government, and accounts and value balances
      are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance 
      Corporation or Securities Investor Protection 
      Corporation protections.
   4. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at
      the state, federal or international level may
      adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange and 
     value of Digital Assets.
   5. Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible,
      and accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
      accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
   6. Some Digital Assets transactions shall be deemed to
      be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is 
      not necessarily the date or time that the customer
      initiates the transactions.
   7. The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the
      continued willingness of market participants to
      exchange fiat currencies for Digital Assets, which
      may result in the potential for permanent and total
      loss of value of a particular virtual currency
      should the market for that virtual currency 
      disappear.
   8. There is no assurance that a person who accepts
      Digital Assets as a payment today will continue to
      do so in the future.
   9. The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an 
      increased risk of fraud or cyber attack, and may
      mean that technological difficulties experienced 
      by the Company may prevent the access or use of
      your Digital Assets.
  10. Your account with Btcpro may not be sufficient to 
      cover all losses incurred by you.

      responsible for determining the nature, potential
      value, suitability, and appropriateness of those
      risks for you, and that Btcpro does not give advice
      or recommendations regarding Digital Assets,
      including the suitability and appropriateness of,
      and investment strategies for, Digital Assets. You 
      acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use
      the Services and the Site at your own risk. This 
      brief statement does not disclose all of the risks

      in Digital Assets. You should, therefore, carefully
      consider whether such trading, exchanging and
      storing’s are suitable for you in light of your 
      circumstances and financial resources. You should
      be aware that you may sustain a total loss of the
